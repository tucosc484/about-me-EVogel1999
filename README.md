## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
I am a website developer for the Cyber4All research team here at Towson in YR404.  Most of my experience has come on the job or through
taking online corses I found interesting from Udemy.  What brought me to the computer science major was the creativity and critical
thinking involved in it.  It challenges me to think out of the box.  I'm taking this class to learn more about website development so I
can be a better asset in my career and learn more about the stuff I already know.

## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression would be to work for either a website or mobile development company or a place that develops a product that
the general public uses (like Google, Netflix, ect.).  I want the ability to travel outside of the U.S. somewhat regularly so also a
company that is multinational.  However, small start ups have their own charm as well.  Eventually I would like to work my way up to a
project lead position, as I enjoy managing the flow of the project development.

## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have plenty of programming experience ranging from web, mobile, backend, and front end.  I've worked with HTML, CSS, SASS, Java, Python,
C++, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Angular.  I have website experience from my job in the Cyber4All research
group, we use node, angular, express, and mongoDB.
